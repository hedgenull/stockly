# Stockly: A Ruby/Rails stock tracker app

Stockly is my version of the stock tracker in John Elder's course at https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-code-and-ruby-on-rails-bundle/.

## IMPORTANT NOTE!
To get Stockly started, you must first create a free account at [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) and register an API key.
Then, in the base directory, create a `.config` file and put the API key into it.
That's all!
